Description: SmoothR is an R package specifically designed to streamline the setup and management of Slurm job environments. It creates a project-specific directory, housing its own SLURM configuration in a separate directory, thus facilitating the easy configuration of environment variables, session management, and integration with the Slurm job submission system. Essentially, SmoothR acts as an organizer for R projects within a remote compute cluster.
